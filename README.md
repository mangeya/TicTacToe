# TicTacToe
A classic game of TicTacToe I coded for a project. Play it easily on a Pygame compiler!

Modules imported: tkinter, CSV, Pygame, OS, time, random. Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. The Pygame module is used to create games
using Python. The ‘import CSV’ command is used to import an inbuilt module to use CSV files, including reading and writing. The OS module in Python 
provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.
